    "I tried getting rid of duplicates a few ways; doing pairwise levenshtein distance comparisons between all the tweets took way too long, and creating a mask to then drop duplicate tweets was also complicated. I noticed that most very-similar-basically-duplicate tweets had the same text, but different handles and urls. So I took a slice of part of the text that was very likely to be shared between the similar tweets, created a new column in the dataset where each tweet-row got a corresponding tweet-slice, and then I deleted the rows where there were duplicate tweet-slices. As you can see, this resulted in a *lot* of data loss (3000+ tweets down to 850; see twitter_drop a few cells down), because many of them were duplicate/spam tweets.\n",
